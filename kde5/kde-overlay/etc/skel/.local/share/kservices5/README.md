# modified-kservices5-plasma5
Modified (fixed) versions of the Netrunner KDE System Service for improved compatibility under Plasma 5

I noticed while working on the NEW Netrunner Rolling ISO that many of the *.desktop files used in NR16 were still using the kcmshell4 kcm versions.
These files have been fixed to use the kcmshell5 versions instead insuring better compatability.
